# app-view-columns
A Gnome Shell extension to set the number of columns in the Applications Overview.

This extension changes the maximum number of columns viewable,
and the "compact" switch forces the Shell to increase the minimum number of columns.

The extension, however, does not control the size of the icons
nor the truncating of the text. Nor do I currently know how to change that behaviour.
